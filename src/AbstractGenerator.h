/**
 * AbstractGenerator is an ABC that defines the API a Generator must provide
 * to work with the existing Generator infrastructure (GenGen, RunGen,
 * Generator Stubs). The existing Generator<>-based instances all implement
 * this API, but any other code that implements this (and uses RegisterGenerator
 * to register itself) should be indistinguishable from a user perspective.
 *
 * An AbstractGenerator is meant to be "single-use"; typically lifetimes will be
 * something like:
 * - create an instance (with a specific Target)
 * - optionally set GeneratorParam values
 * - optionally re-bind inputs (if using in JIT or Stub modes)
 * - call build_pipeline()
 * - optionally call get_funcs_for_output() to get the output(s) (if using in JIT or Stub modes)
 * - discard the instance
 *
 * AbstractGenerators should be fairly cheap to instantiate! Don't try to re-use
 * one by re-setting inputs and calling build_pipeline() multiple times.
 *
 * Note that an AbstractGenerator instance is (generally) stateful in terms of the order
 * that methods should be called; calling the methods out of order may cause
 * assert-fails or other undesirable behavior. Read the method notes carefully!
