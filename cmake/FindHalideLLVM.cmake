FindHalideLLVM
--------------

This find module locates LLVM, Clang, and LLD the way Halide intends to
use it. LLVM and its associated components have many idiosyncrasies in
their CMake packages. This module attempts to paper over them.

Optional components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module respects several optional components:

* ``Clang``
* ``LLD``
* ``<target>`` - any of of the following Halide-supported targets:
    * ``AArch64``
    * ``AMDGPU``
    * ``ARM``
    * ``Hexagon``
    * ``Mips``
    * ``NVPTX``
    * ``PowerPC``
    * ``RISCV``
    * ``WebAssembly`` - depends on ``LLD``
    * ``X86``

Input variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``Halide_SHARED_LLVM`` -- link to the shared library instead of a set
  of static libraries
* ``Halide_BUNDLE_LLVM`` -- link directly to the unpacked object files
  of the set of static libraries.

Result variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This package defines the following variables:

* ``HalideLLVM_FOUND`` -- set to true if the package was found,
  including all required components.
* ``HalideLLVM_<comp>_FOUND`` -- set to true if the component was
  found and false if not. Defined only for requested components.
* ``HalideLLVM_VERSION`` -- set to the LLVM version that was found.
* ``HalideLLVM_TARGETS`` -- the list of requested ``<target>``s that
  were actually found, whether required or not.

It also forwards the following variables from the underlying LLVM
package.

* ``LLVM_LIBCXX`` -- set to the version of libc++ to which LLVM
  was linked, or to -1 if it was not.
* ``LLVM_ENABLE_RTTI`` -- set to true if LLVM was compiled with
  RTII enabled.

Imported targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the IMPORTED targets:

* ``Halide::LLVM`` -- links to LLVM such that all of the REQUIRED targets
  and as many of the OPTIONAL targets as possible are included. Defines
  the preprocessor directive ``WITH_<TARGET>`` (uppercase) when
  ``<target>`` is included.
* ``Halide::clang`` -- the main clang executable (when ``Clang``
  component is found).
* ``Halide::llvm-as`` -- the ``llvm-as`` executable.
